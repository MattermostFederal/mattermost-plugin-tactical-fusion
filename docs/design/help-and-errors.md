# Built-in documentation and error codes

> Design rationale for Tactical Fusion. See [CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md) for the rules that govern day-to-day work; this file records the measurements, the defects that produced the current shape, and the contracts a later change would silently break.

## Built-in documentation

`public/help/` holds seven static HTML pages and one stylesheet. Mattermost
serves the bundle's `public/` directory at `/plugins/<id>/public/**`, so
**there is no route for this in the server code** and nothing to add to
`ServeHTTP`. The build already copies it: `build/setup.mk` sets `HAS_PUBLIC`
from the directory's existence and the `bundle` target acts on it.

| Page | Covers | Kept in sync with |
|---|---|---|
| `help.html` | Landing page, what a decorator is, the consequences of server-side decoration, nav cards | The overall surface |
| `formats.html` | Every recognized grammar, the declined list with reasons, protected spans | `server/decorators/dtg/dtg.go`, `parse.go`, `tagger.go` |
| `panel.html` | The sidebar, the hover, the standalone page, Customize your view, the picker, zone ordering | `webapp/src/decorators/dtg/` |
| `admin.html` | One section per switch, and what a switch does not do | `plugin.json` `settings_schema.settings` |
| `commands.html` | `examples`, `example-details`, `check`, bare and unknown subcommands | `server/command*.go` |
| `troubleshooting.html` | Symptom, cause, fix, quoting the exact user-facing strings | Every message in the server |
| `error-codes.html` | The `TF-NNNN` registry, grouped by source file | `server/errcode/codes.go` |

Three things discover it, and `server/help_docs_test.go` guards the first:

- **`plugin.json` `settings_schema.header`**, a markdown link. This is the one
  place the plugin id is written out, which is correct: `plugin.json` defines
  it.
- **The sidebar panel**, a Documentation link beside "Customize your view",
  built from `docsUrl()` in `webapp/src/plugin_url.ts`.
- **`README.md`**.

There is deliberately **no slash command surface**. Were one added, note the
trap the sibling plugin documents: a Go helper building the URL from
`manifest.Id` must be a **function, not a package-level `var`**, because var
initialisers run before the generated `init()` populates the manifest and a var
would read nil and panic at activation.

The pages are **static, light-only, and self-contained**: no JavaScript, no
remote fonts or assets, no dark mode. They must render on an air-gapped host.
A test enforces this, along with the repo-wide em dash ban, which
`check-style` does not cover because it does not lint HTML.

**Anchor ids are a contract.** Pages deep-link into each other, and a renamed id
fails silently: the browser lands at the top and the reader never learns they
missed the section. `TestEveryCrossPageAnchorResolves` walks every
`href="page.html#id"` in the bundle and is the reason renaming one is safe.

Admin setting headings carry `data-setting="EnableDTG"` alongside a readable
`id`. The attribute exists only so `TestEverySettingIsDocumented` can pair a
section with a manifest key exactly, rather than encoding a
PascalCase-to-kebab convention that would break the first time a key was named
something the rule did not expect.

## Error codes

Every user-facing failure and every `p.API.Log*` call carries a `TF-NNNN`
identifier, so the code a reader quotes from the sidebar and the code an
operator greps out of the log are the same one. That is the whole job: it
pairs a message with its branch within one build.

`server/errcode` holds the catalog. Codes are allocated in thousand-wide
ranges, one per source file, listed in the package documentation. Within a range
they go in source order the first time a file is instrumented and drift
afterwards, which is fine.

**Codes are not stable across releases.** A number may be renumbered, and a
retired one goes back in the pool rather than leaving a gap, so a code carries
meaning only together with the version that emitted it. That is a deliberate
trade for a pre-1.0 plugin, and the thing it costs is old support tickets: a
`TF-16003` quoted last release may name a different branch this one. The
version is in the sidebar's empty state, which is the fastest thing to ask a
reporter for.

- `WithCode(code, msg)` suffixes a string. `Errorf(code, format, ...)` builds an
  error already suffixed, for `preferences.go`, whose `err.Error()` reaches the
  reader verbatim.
- A log call takes `"error_code", errcode.X` as its **first** key/value pair.
- Where a failure is both logged and returned, the two share one code. They are
  one failure.

Adding a code means four edits that go together: the constant, the `AllCodes`
entry, the call site, and a row in `public/help/error-codes.html`.
`TestAllCodesComplete` parses `codes.go` with `go/ast` to enforce the first two
(nothing at runtime can see a constant that is never mentioned), and
`TestEveryCodeIsDocumented` enforces the fourth.
